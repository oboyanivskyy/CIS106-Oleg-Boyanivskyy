# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy
I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side. Besides this being part of the first semester curriculum, I believe I will gain a lot of useful information from this class.
