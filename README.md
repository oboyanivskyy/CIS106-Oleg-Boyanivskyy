# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side of it. I believe this course will help set the ground work for my Information Systems career. I'm also very interested in learning about different programming languages and how to write code. Not only will this help me with my career, but it will also be great information to know for any personal projects that I would want to do. This will provide many benefits no matter where I go, as all industries begin depending on technology.
