# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side of it. I believe this course will help set the ground work for my Information Systems career. I'm also very interested in learning about different programming languages and how to write code. Not only will this help me with my career, but it will also be great information to know for any personal projects that I would want to do. This will provide many benefits no matter where I go, as all industries begin depending on technology.

## Assignment 2

After thoughtful consideration, I decided that I will be picking Python as my preferred programming language to learn for this course. I picked this language because after reading into each one, I determined that this language would be easiest to start out with. I also noticed that Python is still a popular language in today's world and it would be beneficial to have that knowledge. I intend to use this programming language to develop my first programs as a programmer. The IDE that I used to test is Thonny, and my code ran without issues. Since this is the IDE that was recommended to use to start with for Python, that's the main reason why I will be using it. The other IDE I tested was the one included with Python itself when you download it. Even though it is the official one included, I will still use Thonny.

## Assignemnt 3

This chapter has been very informative in teaching the first steps of programming. I learned how to define certain data like integers, real values, and strings. This tells the computer how to define each data point. Using the examples from Wikiuniversity really helped with setting up the variables and how to avoid errors. I also learned that the simpler you can write what you want into a program, the more likely it will work and have fewer errors. Making these two programs from the activities in Wikiuniversity really made me think outside the box, really similar to the first assignment we had with the food preparation instructions. The computer doesn't know what you know, so you have to define each variable and tell the computer what it is and how you want the computer to use it. I will apply this learning to all my future programming projects as it's just the beginning of reworking my brain to make this more of a habit and part of the workflow of designing a program.
