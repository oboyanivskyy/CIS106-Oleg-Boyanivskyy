# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side of it. I believe this course will help set the ground work for my Information Systems career. I'm also very interested in learning about different programming languages and how to write code.
