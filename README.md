# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side of it. I believe this course will help set the ground work for my Information Systems career. I'm also very interested in learning about different programming languages and how to write code. Not only will this help me with my career, but it will also be great information to know for any personal projects that I would want to do. This will provide many benefits no matter where I go, as all industries begin depending on technology.

## Assignment 2

After thoughtful consideration, I decided that I will be picking Python as my preferred programming language to learn for this course. I picked this language because after reading into each one, I determined that this language would be easiest to start out with. I also noticed that Python is still a popular language in today's world and it would be beneficial to have that knowledge. I intend to use this programming language to develop my first programs as a programmer. The IDE that I used to test is Thonny, and my code ran without issues. Since this is the IDE that was recommended to use to start with for Python, that's the main reason why I will be using it. The other IDE I tested was the one included with Python itself when you download it. Even though it is the official one included, I will still use Thonny.

## Assignment 3

This chapter has been very informative in teaching the first steps of programming. I learned how to define certain data like integers, real values, and strings. This tells the computer how to define each data point. Using the examples from Wikiversity really helped with setting up the variables and how to avoid errors. I also learned that the simpler you can write what you want into a program, the more likely it will work and have fewer errors. Making these two programs from the activities in Wikiversity really made me think outside the box, really similar to the first assignment we had with the food preparation instructions. The computer doesn't know what you know, so you have to define each variable and tell the computer what it is and how you want the computer to use it. I will apply this learning to all my future programming projects as it's just the beginning of reworking my brain to make this more of a habit and part of the workflow of designing a program.

## Assignment 4

Rereading the chapter again really helped me clarify and learn more about the different types of operators that can be used to identify data to the programming language. Also from this chapter, I started coding straight from Thonny itself instead of Flowgorithim just so I could get the hang of typing in the code myself. I found that this made it easier for me to remember how to define what I need and how to tell the IDE what I want it to do. I was also able to look through the Wikiversity links again and freshen up on the different examples used. Overall, this chapter was a great way to cover last week's material again and it made it easier to remember and start to get the hang of the operators and data points.

## Assignment 5

After reading Chapter 5, I must say that I have been blown away as to how complex a program can get with functions and calling them. I have learned how to create a separate function from the "main" one, and define to do a simple task. After watching some of the YouTube videos on Wikiversity, it makes sense to me why this exists and why it is helpful. The functions help organize my code and create an easier workflow to saving code for future use. I also really enjoyed learning about calling a funciton and how it is used to go back to the "main" function. I had some struggles at first, as I kept forgetting to define my variables and thus, it generated errors. However, using Flowgorithim has helped greatly with seeing what I'm missing and being able to play around with it to make it work. Overall, this chapter introduced a lot of new concepts, and I have been very excited with playing around with them.

## Assignment 6

With Assignment 6, I started with rereading the chapter just like instructed. To a similar result like last week, I was able to understand more from the chapter and solidify my understanding from last week. After going through a lot of trial and error last week, being able to write the correct directly on my IDE was a lot easier than using Flowgorithim. I found that I get lost sometimes with Flowgorithim UI, and then it makes me overthink something or complicate it further. Looking at the Wikiversity examples and source code from my previous programs, rewriting two of my previous programs was a lot easier and simpler for me. I'm starting to get a better understanding as to what the program wants to see, and I'm able to do it without making many changes. I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge even further and making my programs more complex in the future chapters.

## Assignment 7

In Assignment 7 we are introduced to Conditions and I think this is a very big part of programming. The first part of the chapter we learn about selection control structures which evaluates whether a specified Boolean condition is true or false. This determine which path the program decides to go. We are also introduced to the if-then-else construct which is a two-way selection that is common across many programming languages. Compound statements are also talked about and they are used if you have more than one statement that you want to use. One thing I found interesting was the different relational operators and how equality is == instead of =, which I could see many people get confused. Overall, I like the if-then statements and I feel it adds another layer of comlexion to the code and makes it more modular.

## Assignment 8

In Assignment 8, this is the first time we are introduced to loops and the different kinds of loops. Since this will take some time to learn, this week's main focus was on while loops and how to incorporate them into your programming. While loops are really important for programs involving making calculations or counting as shown in the textbook examples. They allow for repeated action until the loop is no longer true, in which it will continue and move on to the next piece of code. It was mentioned a couple times that a beginner's first mistake with loops, is making an infinite loop, which is something I did when first trying to code my first activity. Flowgorithim helped out a lot with understanding how I should write the loops, but doing the second activity with my IDE was still easier to organize and group everything. I'm really excited with the amount of progress that my programs have gone through, and loops just added another huge step in complexity.

## Assignment 9

In Assignment 9 we continue with learning about loops by being introduced to a Do While loop. Compared to last week, I struggled quite a bit with understanding how the Do While loop works. With one of my activities, I can't seem to get it to make the proper calculation with this loop. I believe I may be writing an incorrect value somewhere or just forgetting a step, but I can't seem to figure it out just yet. I will try to reread more of the book and go over the examples again to get a better understanding. Overall, I can see how Do While loops can help in certain situations, they are just harder for me to understand than While loops.

## Assignment 10

Coming back from Spring Break and jumping into Assignment 10 was surprisingly easier than I expected. Using my previous knowledge from Assignments 8 and 9, "for loops" were a lot easier to grasp than the previous types of loops. I feel that they are easier to implement into a program when needed to be used to count. Especially compared to "while loops" as the program kept testing to check if the loop was satisfied, "for loops" allowed me to make less errors when designing the program, and I also didn't end up making an infinite loop at all. Overall, I enjoyed learning about this type of loop and adding it to my programming knowledge.

## Assignment 11

For Assignment 11, we are pretty much done with the basic logic aspects of a program and are introduced into Arrays. At first glance reading the chapter, it makes sense as to why Arrays are used. After reading the chapter and looking through the examples, I began writing the structure of my programs and realized that Arrays are harder to implement than I thought. I believe for the fixed length arrays, I was able to get a good amount done however I'm still having issues writing the Array code in. For defined value arrays, it was a little harder as for the fixed length activity, I was able to use some of the Python example code for that particular activity. Overall, I could see the usefullness, but at the moment, I'm having a bit of trouble with actually implementing the Array.

## Assignment 12

For Assignment 12, we are now learning and applying our knowledge for dynamic arrays. After struggling a bit last week with getting the hang of arrays, it was easier to come back to them this week. I still was confused on certain parts, but the logic behind it is starting to make more sense as to how I should setup my programs. The issues arise when it comes to using my overall previous knowledge and it sometimes not working with the arrays since it is a list, and not an integer or string. The textbook examples help out when I need a reference to look at, or my previous activities. Overall, I have definitely improved a good amount since last week with Arrays.

## Assignment 13
