# CIS106-Oleg-Boyanivskyy

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because I switched majors from Nursing to Information Systems. I have always had an interest in computers, and would like to learn more about the software side of it. I believe this course will help set the ground work for my Information Systems career. I'm also very interested in learning about different programming languages and how to write code. Not only will this help me with my career, but it will also be great information to know for any personal projects that I would want to do. This will provide many benefits no matter where I go, as all industries begin depending on technology.

## Assignment 2

After thoughtful consideration, I decided that I will be picking Python as my preferred programming language to learn for this course. I picked this language because after reading into each one, I determined that this language would be easiest to start out with. I also noticed that Python is still a popular language in today's world and it would be beneficial to have that knowledge. I intend to use this programming language to develop my first programs as a programmer. The IDE that I used to test is Thonny, and my code ran without issues. Since this is the IDE that was recommended to use to start with for Python, that's the main reason why I will be using it. The other IDE I tested was the one included with Python itself when you download it. Even though it is the official one included, I will still use Thonny.

## Assignment 3

This chapter has been very informative in teaching the first steps of programming. I learned how to define certain data like integers, real values, and strings. This tells the computer how to define each data point. Using the examples from Wikiversity really helped with setting up the variables and how to avoid errors. I also learned that the simpler you can write what you want into a program, the more likely it will work and have fewer errors. Making these two programs from the activities in Wikiversity really made me think outside the box, really similar to the first assignment we had with the food preparation instructions. The computer doesn't know what you know, so you have to define each variable and tell the computer what it is and how you want the computer to use it. I will apply this learning to all my future programming projects as it's just the beginning of reworking my brain to make this more of a habit and part of the workflow of designing a program.

## Assignment 4

Rereading the chapter again really helped me clarify and learn more about the different types of operators that can be used to identify data to the programming language. Also from this chapter, I started coding straight from Thonny itself instead of Flowgorithim just so I could get the hang of typing in the code myself. I found that this made it easier for me to remember how to define what I need and how to tell the IDE what I want it to do. I was also able to look through the Wikiversity links again and freshen up on the different examples used. Overall, this chapter was a great way to cover last week's material again and it made it easier to remember and start to get the hang of the operators and data points.

## Assignment 5

After reading Chapter 5, I must say that I have been blown away as to how complex a program can get with functions and calling them. I have learned how to create a separate function from the "main" one, and define to do a simple task. After watching some of the YouTube videos on Wikiversity, it makes sense to me why this exists and why it is helpful. The functions help organize my code and create an easier workflow to saving code for future use. I also really enjoyed learning about calling a funciton and how it is used to go back to the "main" function. I had some struggles at first, as I kept forgetting to define my variables and thus, it generated errors. However, using Flowgorithim has helped greatly with seeing what I'm missing and being able to play around with it to make it work. Overall, this chapter introduced a lot of new concepts, and I have been very excited with playing around with them.

## Assignment 6

With Assignment 6, I started with rereading the chapter just like instructed. To a similar result like last week, I was able to understand more from the chapter and solidify my understanding from last week. After going through a lot of trial and error last week, being able to write the correct directly on my IDE was a lot easier than using Flowgorithim. I found that I get lost sometimes with Flowgorithim UI, and then it makes me overthink something or complicate it further. Looking at the Wikiversity examples and source code from my previous programs, rewriting two of my previous programs was a lot easier and simpler for me. I'm starting to get a better understanding as to what the program wants to see, and I'm able to do it without making many changes. I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge even further and making my programs more complex in the future chapters.

## Assignment 7
